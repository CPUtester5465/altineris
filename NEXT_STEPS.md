# ðŸš€ Your Behavioral Profiler Website is Ready!

## âœ… Completed Setup

âœ… **Environment Variables** - Supabase credentials configured  
âœ… **Form Integration** - Both participant and researcher forms connect to Supabase  
âœ… **Frontend Complete** - All three sections transformed according to PRD  
âœ… **Development Server** - Running on http://localhost:5175/  

## ðŸ”¥ Critical Next Step: Database Schema

**You MUST run the database schema before testing forms!**

### 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/mlznnqhzipnaujvhlnwu
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### 2. Run Database Schema
Copy and paste the entire contents of `database/schema.sql` into the SQL editor and click **Run**.

This will create:
- `participant_signups` table
- `researcher_signups` table  
- Security policies (Row Level Security)
- Analytics views
- Proper indexes

### 3. Test Your Website
1. Open http://localhost:5175/
2. Navigate through all three sections:
   - **Section 1**: Hero with behavioral profiling message
   - **Section 2**: Research paths (try hovering over options)
   - **Section 3**: Trust & details with working signup forms
3. Test both signup forms - data should save to Supabase!
